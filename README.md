Extension supports all types of credentials. It searches for aws credentials in the following order:
- Environment Variables:

  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  - AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional, for temporary credentials)

- Shared Credentials File:
  - ~/.aws/credentials (default profile or a named profile)
  - ~/.aws/config (for region settings)

- Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS):
  - When running on an EC2 instance with an attached IAM role, credentials are retrieved from http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/

- Amazon ECS Container Credentials:
  - When running in an ECS task, the SDK retrieves credentials from the container metadata URI (provided by ECS agent).

- SSO Credentials:
  - If you've configured SSO using the AWS CLI, the SDK will attempt to retrieve credentials from your SSO login session.

- Web Identity Token (IAM Roles for Service Accounts):
  - For federated identity access, such as AWS IAM roles for Kubernetes (EKS).
